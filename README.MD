# LitePress


## What is it?
It's a simple script that can (and should) be used to run/test WordPress themes.
It has some default content to partially make you're theme usable (and testable).
**This is not WordPress**


## Where are the docs?
I didn't have time to write any docs, let alone proper comments in my scripts, 
but the majority of the functions in this script work (should work) like their WordPress counterparts.


## How to use?
Simply drop the project into any WordPress theme and that theme should work independent of WordPress.
Yes, you can use it to replace you're WordPress installation, but I wouldn't recommend it.
