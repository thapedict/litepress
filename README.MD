# LitePress


## What is it?
It's a simple script that can (and should) be used to run/test WordPress themes.
It has some default content to partially make you're theme usable (and testable).
**This is not WordPress** (it just works like it)


## How to use?
Simply drop the project into any WordPress theme and that theme should work as a full website running WordPress.
Yes, you can use it to replace you're WordPress installation, but I wouldn't recommend it.
